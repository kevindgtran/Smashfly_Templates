<h2>The IDEA team is passionate about making a difference in our customers&rsquo; lives and we're achieving this in three distinct ways:</h2>
<p>1. We build awesome data products. But not just any product, we're talking core data products for Intuit: A/B testing, user segmentation, big data crunching building blocks such as funnel analysis, path analysis, etc.</p>
<p>2. Our data products have a direct impact on customers. They're in existing Intuit products such as personalization and recommendation; and in new products by leveraging Intuit&rsquo;s commerce graph, implicit / transaction-based social network, lending, and cross-Intuit product recommendation apps.</p>
<p>3. We're quickly becoming a leader in the data space: Data engineering, data science, and data products - internally and externally, all while contributing to open-source.</p>
<p>IDEA is revolutionizing engineering at Intuit, data driven decision making at Intuit, and building product at Intuit. We are leading by example and partnering with all Intuit product teams including Mint, QuickBooks, TurboTax, and SnapTax.</p>
